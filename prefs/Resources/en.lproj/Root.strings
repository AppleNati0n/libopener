	<string>Opener is a developer library for overriding link destinations - for example, to redirect opening a YouTube link in Safari to a 3rd-party YouTube app.

You currently don’t have any handler packages installed. This can happen after uninstalling all packages that depend on Opener, such as MapsOpener and YTOpener. To remove this Settings page, search for “Opener” in Cydia, then tap Modify and Remove.</string>
